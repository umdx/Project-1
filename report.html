    <p>This website was made with the idea of helping The Chantilly Youth Baseball Association,
        a local organization in NOVA. 
        There are 5 different pages the user can access: the homepage, the about us page,
        the coaches page, the basics page, and the contact us page.
        There is a header along with a navigation bar / hamburger menu to help the user
        access each individual page. The user can also scroll down to have easier access to
        the pages.
        Each page has a favicon in the footer. Favicons are also located in the hamburger menu.
        The homepage has a animation for the home image. Along with that, each coach card has
        a tilt animation when the user hovers over it.
        All CSS and images are placed in their own folder.
        The website utilizes different font faces and content is neatly aligned / organized.
        The website includes one external link to a Youtube video introducing the basics of baseball.
